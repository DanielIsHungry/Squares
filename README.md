# Square Pattern Printer

A simple Java program that prints a rectangle (or square) of asterisks (`*`) based on user input for rows and columns.

## How It Works
- The program asks the user to enter:
  1. Number of rows  
  2. Number of columns  
- It then prints a block of `*` characters with the specified dimensions.

Example:
```
Enter number of rows: 
4
Enter number of columns: 
3
```
Output:
```
****
****
****
```

## Running the Program
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac square.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java square
   ```
